# scorched3d
 A cross-platform multiplayer modernisation of the classic DOS game Scorched Earth, "The Mother Of All Games", with fully destructible 3D landcapes and stunning visual effects.
 
The repo itself was made to fix stores that take forever to burn (especially after blowing up a nuclear power plant or meteor issues).
Who knows where it'll take us, though...
